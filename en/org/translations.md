Currently all of our documentation is written in English. Having multiple translations of the Yarn documentation would help reduce the worldwide barrier to entry for understanding how to use Yarn and how Yarn works.

As you can see at the top of our website, we have a placeholder specifically to list various translations -- **we would love the help from the community to make these various translations happen**.

Here are some steps to help you get started.

1. Clone the [Yarn website repo](https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/). 
1. Add your documentation under your specific language in the root of the `website` repo (see `./en/` for an example). Using tooling to help with this process is definitely acceptable.
1. Add your specific language configuration to `_data/i18n`.
1. Enable your specific language in `./_data/languages.yml`.

Please file [issues](https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/yarnpkg/website/pulls) if you are willing to help with one or more language translations of the Yarn documentation.
