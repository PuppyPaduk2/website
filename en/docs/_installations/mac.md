### macOS

The easiest way to install Yarn on macOS is to use
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/index.html). If you do not have Homebrew installed
already you can do so by following
[these instructions](http://brew.sh/index.html#install).

Once you have Homebrew installed, you can install Yarn by running the following
code in your terminal:

```sh
brew install yarn
```
