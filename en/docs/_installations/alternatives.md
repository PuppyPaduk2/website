### Alternatives

If you are using another OS or one of the other options specific to your OS
will not work for you, there are a couple of alternatives. You will need to
[install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't already have it installed.

#### Install via npm

You can also install Yarn through the [npm package manager](http://npmjs.org/)
if you already have it installed. If you already have
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed then you should already have npm.

Once you have npm installed you can run:

```sh
npm install --global yarnpkg
```
