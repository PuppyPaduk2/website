<p class="lead">Clear registry username and email.</p>

##### `yarn logout`

This will remove your stored username and email for the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) as setup by
[`yarn login`](login). You do need to run this to de-authenticate, registry
actions are individually authenticated.
